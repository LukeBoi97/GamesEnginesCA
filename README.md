Description of what you did
I plan on building a procedurally generated terrain with different types of landscapes. The main landscape will be a mountain valley style of landscape like something out of the avatar. When the user clicks play the system will automatically generate a new world each time with random hills and pits embedded throughout. The user will be able to explore the landcape with their arrow keys. I will use a lot of the tutorials and courses on unity to learn how to implement these complex procedures.

What you are most proud of about the assignment
Building the infinite terrain and the perlin noise used to make the mesh terrain. This took many hours to get the right fit and make it look like a real mountain valley.

What resources were useful for you (websites, tutorials, assets etc)
Resources researched:
All of these resources were a great help in building this procedural terrain generation.
