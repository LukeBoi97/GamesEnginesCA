I plan on building a procedurally generated terrain with different types of landscapes. The main landscape will be a sandy dune style of landscape like something out of the mongolian plains. When the user clicks play the system will automatically generate a new world each time with random hills and pits embedded throughout. The user will be able to explore the landcape with their arrow keys. The hope is to also add a mongolian soldier avatar to roam through this world. I will use a lot of the tutorials and courses on unity to learn how to implement these complex procedures.
